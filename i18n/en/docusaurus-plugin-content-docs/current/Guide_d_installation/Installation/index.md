# Installation


## Introduction


:::info

Technical domain "xxx.internal"

At the end of the installation process, a technical domain named "xxx.internal" is shown instead of the domain name entered – while the domain name entered is shown as the alias.

This is normal behavior from BlueMind version 4.3 – because the main domain name cannot be edited, this allows you to edit the domain name chosen during installation at any later time.

This domain name's presence is only temporary. It will be hidden in future versions of BlueMind – domain names will continue to work the same way, but this behavior will be made transparent, only the domain name chosen and its aliases will be shown in the admin console.
