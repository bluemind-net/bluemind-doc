# Access

In order to access specific tool features, (submit JIRA tickets, submit and vote in the Suggestion Box, MarketPlace), you need to create an account through our identity platform: [https://forge.blue-mind.net/identity/](https://forge.blue-mind.net/identity/).

This will make all tools available to you automatically (your log in ID is passed on to the support platform within **10 minutes**, and within 30 minutes for other tools).

To post on the forum, you need to [create an account](http://forum.blue-mind.net/register.php).

# Recommendations for use

## Support and bug tracking

The bug-tracking platform is open to all, users as well as clients.

For your request to be processed promptly, you need to provide as detailed a description of the issue or bug identified as possible:

- Describe the reproducible process that shows the malfunction
- Attach logs that will help us analyse the issue 
- In the case of UI bugs, add a screenshot to your ticket if needed as well as information on the browser used (name, version, OS, etc.)


Bear in mind that our support teams don't have access to your platform. This means tests will be performed on a reference platform. A precise description is therefore indispensable.

## Forum

Please double-check with the search engine that your issue or question hasn't been addressed yet. This will save you time if a reply has already been provided.

As suggested above, please be polite and describe your request as precisely as you can.

## Suggestion Box

The Suggestion Box allows you to suggest new features. It is available in English only.

The Suggestion Box helps us identify and prioritize the most relevant submissions for our R&D teams to consider.

To this end, please first search through existing submissions to make sure that your suggestion doesn't exist already. You can then vote for it (log in required) and help prioritize it.

Failing that, you can create a new suggestion. Please be thorough so that your request may be considered by other users.
