# Logs


# Introduction

BlueMind keeps log files for each application and usage type.
:::important

It is important to provide for enough disk space to store log and archive files.

Space overload stops new information from being saved into log files and can lead to sluggish, and possibly blocked, services.

:::


There are 3 types of log files:

- system logs, which rely on log administration mechanisms ([rsyslog](http://www.rsyslog.com/) + [logrotate](https://linux.die.net/man/8/logrotate))
- 
BlueMind's Java services log, which rely on [LogBack](https://logback.qos.ch/)
:::important

Track times

Java-generated tracks in these files are set to GMT.

As a result, in France, which is in the Europe/Paris time zone, times are +1h in the winter and +2h in the summer. To find items that took place at 15:00, you need to look for:

  - 14:00 from late October to late March
  - 13:00 from late March to late October

:::
- internal service logs, managed by each service's configuration.


Storage time depends on each log administration mechanism's settings. These settings can be changed to the desired storage time.

# Log files

Log files are located in the `/var/log` file and its subfolders.
