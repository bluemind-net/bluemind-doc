# Authentication Methods


- [SSO CAS](/Guide_de_l_administrateur/Configuration/Gestion_des_domaines/Les_méthodes_d_authentification/Mise_en_place_du_SSO_CAS/)
- [SSO Kerberos](/Guide_de_l_administrateur/Configuration/Gestion_des_domaines/Les_méthodes_d_authentification/Mise_en_place_du_SSO_Kerberos/)


BlueMind incorporates a user database which, when it is not synchronized with an external user database, includes passwords. Authentication is then managed fully and autonomously by BlueMind.

BlueMind manages the connection to external LDAP and ActiveDirectory directories. In this case, authentication is delegated to these directories, securely, without BlueMind knowing any passwords. To find out more about connecting to external directories, go to the relevant documentation pages:

- [Active Directory Synchronization](/Guide_de_l_administrateur/Gestion_des_entités/Synchronisation_Active_Directory/)
- [LDAP Synchronization](/Guide_de_l_administrateur/Gestion_des_entités/Synchronisation_LDAP/)
