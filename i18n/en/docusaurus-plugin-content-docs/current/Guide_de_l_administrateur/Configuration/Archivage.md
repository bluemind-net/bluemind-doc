# Archiving


# Introduction

BlueMind has a centralized archiving system. This enables you to take some weight off storage servers by storing some messages (older ones for example) on another server (or a mount point on another storage system) with lower storage costs.

BlueMind uses server-side archiving: this enables you to keep archives together on a single-server, unlike PST archives generated with Outlook which stay on users' machines and must be backed-up.

Hierarchical storage allows you to specify different storage spaces, usually to have extra storage space with lesser performances (and at a lower cost). BlueMind's hierarchical archiving system has the following characteristics:

- archiving rules (messages older than X days, etc.) by user, group and domain.
- archive access from BlueMind webmail and thick clients (Thunderbird, Outlook, etc.).

![](../../attachments/79862828/79862830.png) In BlueMind 4.0, archiving is completely automatic and transparent, which means that users no longer have an "archiving" button or able to see a message's archive status.

# Implementing an archiving policy

To implement archiving, in the admin console:

- go to System Management > System Configuration > Mail tab
- In the Archiving section, check the box and fill in:
  - Number of days before archiving: the number of days before a message is archived
  - 
Size of messages (MiB): threshold above which messages are archived automatically, without waiting for the number of days set
The default value is 1Mb
:::important

The MiB (Mebibyte) is a multiple of a byte, not to be confused with the MB (megabyte): it is equal to 1024 kebibytes, which itself is equal to 1024 bytes.

Therefore, 9 MiB equals 9,43718 MB.

Archiving runs every day at 4am GMT.

# Setting up an archiving space

The partition must be mounted in the `/var/spool/bm-hsm/cyrus-archives/` folder.

# Changes relative to BlueMind 3.5

Changing the archiving system to a completely automatic system has several consequences. As we've said above, users are no longer able to archive messages manually, but also:

- The archiving policy is the same for all domain users
- 
There are no group or user-specific archiving quotas any more. There is just one quota, archived data is accounted for within this one quota in addition to other non-archived messages.

- The scheduled jobs HSMJob and HSMIndexJob are therefore irrelevant and no longer exist.Â
