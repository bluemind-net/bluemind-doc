# Contacts


## Introduction

BlueMind allows you to create several address books, share contacts between groups or users and access a company address book.

Address books can be synchronized with thick clients (Outlook, Thunderbird) and smartphones (iPhone, Android, etc. depending on device capability).

By default, BlueMind sets up 3 address books:

- One personal address book called "My contacts".

- The directory, a public address book that contains all public users in the system.
- Another personal address book called "Collected contacts", which automatically collects the addresses of message recipients not found in the directory.


You can create an unlimited number of address books and precisely specify how they are shared: by user or group, as read or read-and-write.

- ![](../../attachments/57769989/69896496.png) : the first column, under the "New contact" button, shows the list of address books you have access to: your default address books, your personal address books as well as those shared with you and you are subscribed to;
- ![](../../attachments/57769989/69896495.png) : the second column shows the list of contacts in the address book selected in the first column.

The vertical alphabet on the left of the area allows you to navigate more quickly in your contacts. The letters with contacts are highlighted in black and bold for better visibility.

## Editing contacts

To edit a contact, go to the contact's card by first selecting the address book it belongs to, or using the search box at the top of the page.

If you don't have editing rights, the information will simply be displayed and the action buttons grayed out. If you do have editing rights, you will be able to edit the card's contents:

The "Add" button allows you to add other types of information from those available by default: birthday, assistant, instant messaging address, etc.

## Distribution lists

### Creating and editing distribution lists

To create a distribution list, click the drop-down arrow in the "New contact" button and choose "New distribution list":

In the editing page, first enter a title then add the contacts you want to include in the distribution list in the "Add members" box.

Autocomplete searches all address books for matching contacts. The address book the contact belongs to is shown under the contact's name:

Whether a matching name is found or not, a "Create new member" button is displayed. It opens a "Create a new contact" form which allows you to enter a name and an email address:

Adding a member to a distribution list


The new contact is then added to the distribution list as well as the current address book.

### Including distribution lists

A distribution list can be included within another distribution list: when you want to write to the "parent" list, all addresses will be added as recipients – those belonging to the parent list and those belonging to the child list:

:::info

Only lists coming from the same address book can be included. Lists from other address books (belonging to the same user or a shared address book, see below) cannot be included.

This also excludes directory groups which, although they have an email address, are considered as lists.

:::

### Lists and shared address books

You can include contacts from other users' shared address books in distribution lists (provided you have minimum read privileges). 

To make sure that the contacts in a distribution list are up to date, click the "Validate" button to update the whole list. This ensures that you have the latest version if changes have been made the source address books by their owner or right holders.

:::tip

If the owner of the address book the contacts come from revokes sharing rights on this address book, ****the contacts are still included and can be used**** but you will not be able to update them by using the "Validate" button. If at a later date the owner shares the address book again, an update of contacts will automatically be made and the "Validate" button will be operational again.

## Importing and exporting contacts

To import or export an address book as a vCard file, click the gears button above the contacts list in the address book:

When exporting, all contacts in the address book are exported to a single file which opens automatically upon download.

When importing, all contacts in the file are added to the address book. BlueMind does not detect duplicates. All contacts will be added, including those already in the address book.
