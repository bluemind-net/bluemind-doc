# BlueMind Mail


## Introduction

BlueMind has developed a brand new webmail application based on the latest browser technology – Web App Javascript. This has allowed us to build a fully redesigned and intuitive interface with 3 panes adapted to large screens. Most importantly, it helps make the application faster and smoother by using local browser storage.

This application, still in its Beta version, doesn't cover our former webmail's entire perimeter yet, but it works! You can seamlessly switch back to our standard webmail version and keep all your data. This new application's components will be expanded gradually to offer the same features as our old webmail version. 

We therefore encourage you to test it right now, although we do recommend that you be very careful as this being a beta version you may encounter some issues. 

We look forward to hearing your feedback!

## How to try the new webmail

BlueMind's new webmail has to be [installed and provisioned to users by the administrator](/Guide_d_installation/Installation_du_nouveau_client_de_messagerie/).

Once this is done, a toggle button in the top right hand corner of the application lets you switch between classic BlueMind webmail and the new webmail:

You can also switch between versions in your Mail preferences settings:

![](../../attachments/66096291/66099867.png)

1. **Left-hand side column**: folder listThe folder column shows the list of folders which can be grouped into user and shared mailboxes and expanded or collapsed.
2. **Center-column**: list of messages in the folder selected in column A.Filters at the top of the list are used to display a certain type of messages only. Hovering over a message displays information and possible actions.
3. **Right-hand column**: main display areaThe home screen shows possible actions and the message selected is shown when appropriate.
4. **Action bar**: includes the "new message" button, the search engine and actions available depending on the current display (message actions when a message is displayed or group actions when several messages are selected).


## Folder list

### Introduction

The left-hand side column shows the list of folders you have access to – as read-only or read-write – arranged into two collapsible lists:

1. **The user account **shows your own folders: default folders (inbox, sent messages, trash, etc.) followed by the folders you have created, sorted alphabetically
2. **Shared folders**: shows the shared mailboxes you have read and/or write permission on.

User mailboxes

In the current version of the webmail application, user mailboxes are not shown yet. This will be made effective in the final version.

When a folder is selected:

- the messages it contains are shown in the center column
- the name of the folder is shown on a blue background
- the chip showing the number of unread messages in the folder is bright blue:
