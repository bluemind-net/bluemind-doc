# API BlueMind


## Introduction

The BlueMind API has been completely redesigned and is available either directly via HTTP REST calls or using clients (now Java, Javascript, C#, Python, PHP and .NET). The bluemind-samples repository is available and gathers all that is needed to contribute to BlueMind by developing an Add-On. A maven archetype is also available to facilitate the definition of a new project.

An interactive documentation of our new REST API is embedded in the installer: it is the optional bm-docs package. Once installed, the REST API documentation will be available to users with the "Api docs" right. This documentation is also published in the [BlueMind Docs space](https://forge.bluemind.net/apidoc/).
