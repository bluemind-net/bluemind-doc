## Subscribing to a to-do list

This tab allows you to subscribe to to-do lists or to access your lists to enable their synchronization for offline or third-party client (thick client software or mobile device):

 ** ![](../../../attachments/57770650/57770653.png) ** 

When synchronization is enabled for a list, the data is downloaded into the software client. As a result:

|  | Synchronization Enabled | Synchronization Disabled | Web Application and Thunderbird | EAS iOS | EAS (other) | DAV | Outlook |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tasks can be viewed and are available offline | Tasks can be viewed online but unavailable offline |
| 
Tasks can be viewed and are available offline through the *Reminders *app
 | Tasks cannot be viewed |

## Managing Sharing

BlueMind allows you to share to-do lists with others to make them available for viewing or to create shared lists with read and write rights.

![](../../../attachments/57770650/57770651.png)

Possible sharing rights are:

- **Read rights**: users are able to view tasks only, by displaying the list in their calendar view or in their Tasks application.
- **Read and write rights**: in addition being able to view tasks, users can edit, create or delete tasks from the list.
- **Read and write and sharing management rights**: in addition to the rights above, users can manage task sharing from their preferences.


To share a list:

1. Choose the list from the drop-down list at the top of the tab.Users can share: 
    - their personal lists: "My To-do lists" or other lists created
    - the lists they have a delegation on: they have been given the right "Can updated and manage sharing"
2. If you want to make a list public, check the box "Allow public share" and select the rights level you want to give users.
3. ** **Recommended choice** ** ** **:** **If you prefer to assign rights individually to certain users or a group, look for their name in the text box and select the right you want to give them.
4. Once all rights are set as desired, click ** "Save" **to confirm
