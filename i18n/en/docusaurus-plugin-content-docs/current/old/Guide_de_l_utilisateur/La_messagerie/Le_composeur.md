    - **Cc**: recipients the message is copied to ("Carbon copy")

    - **Bcc**: recipients the message is copied to but whose name/address is **concealed** from others ("Blind carbon copy")

- 2 other links allow you to add special fields:
    - **Reply-To**: enter one or several addresses that will be used when the message's recipient uses the "Reply" button. 

    - **Follow-up To**: enter one or several addresses that will be used when the message's recipient uses the "Reply all" button

- Choose the **edition mode**: by default, messages are edited in HTML and formatted. To use an unformatted edition mode, select "plain text". 

- Modify message **priority status.**

- Request a **read receipt **(when the recipient opens the message and if they accept the read receipt request).

- Request a **delivery status receipt** (the recipient's server has received the message).

- The **"From****" **field – for the recipient – is pre-filled with your default identity.
You can select another [identity](/Guide_de_l_utilisateur/La_messagerie/Les_identités/) if you like.


## Sending messages

Click ![](../../attachments/57770262/57770270.png) in the top left corner of the composition window.

## Corporate signatures

### Introduction

When you add recipients in the "To" box, if [corporate signatures](/Guide_de_l_administrateur/Configuration/Signatures_d_entreprise/) have been configured and match the message's senders and recipients criteria, a warning message will pop up telling you about the signature that will be added:

![](../../attachments/57770262/57770264.png)

This allows you to control which signature is used in the event that several matching signatures have been configured (if you belong to several groups, for instance, or if a temporary event signature is active).

### Signature placement

By default, the signature is added at the very end of the message. Some settings allow you to modify this as appropriate.

If the signature's manager has enabled the option allowing users to place the signature, the string "--X-BM-SIGNATURE–" is shown where the signature will appear. This is particularly useful when you're replying to a thread of messages:

![](../../attachments/57770262/57770263.png)

You can therefore move the signature simply by moving this string with:

- select/move
- or cut/paste
- or delete/write again.


:::info

In order to streamline conversations with multiple replies, previous instances of the signature in the message thread will be deleted automatically by the system.

Note that this option is not the default behaviour, it must therefore be enabled by the administrator.
