# Setting Up Apple Contacts


## Introduction


:::info

This guide was written based on OS X Yosemite.

The CardDav protocol is only validated with **native** Mac OS X clients and and preferably up-to-date OS. Given the standard's permissiveness, it is impossible for us to guarantee it will work correctly with other clients using this protocol.
