# Tags


## Introduction

Tags allow you to assign one or several keywords to contacts and calendar events. Tags are shared by both applications.

## Tagging

Calendar events can be tagged in the **Information tab** of the event creation form:

NB: the screenshots below belong to the Contacts application, but the Calendar works similarly.

There are several ways to add tags:

- Existing tags are shown in a **drop-down menu**. To select a tag, click the arrow at the end of the text box to display the list: ![](../attachments/57770802/57770807.png)
- **Type a word**.
    - **If there is no existing tag **for this word, click "Enter" to validate it or click "Create tag": ![](../attachments/57770802/57770806.png)
    - **If a tag already exists**, (from other users or events for example, or via the settings manager) autocomplete suggests words as you type: ![](../attachments/57770802/57770805.png)


Once set, new tags are assigned a color and an "x" is displayed next to them to delete them. Existing tags are marked with the same color as everywhere else they are used. New tags are assigned a color that hasn't been used yet:

You can add as many tags as you want:

To delete a tag, click the "x" next to it or use the delete key (&lt;backspace>) on your keyboard.

Tags can be seen in the contacts list as color icons (2 maximum). When you hover over them, the list of tags assigned to the contact appears:

Similarly, in Calendar, tagged events are marked with a color icon:

## Managing tags


:::info

Domain tags are managed similarly by the administrator in the admin console > System management > Managed Domains > domain > "Tags"
see the Administrator's Guide - [Domaines - chapître 7 : Les étiquettes](/Guide_de_l_administrateur/Présentation_du_produit/Messagerie_multi_domaines/)

:::

Tags can be managed in user settings > "My account" > "Tags" tab

:::info

Shared tags, created by the domain administrator, cannot be edited. They are shown in bold with a lock next to them at the top of the list.

By default, all your tags and domain tags are listed:

- click a tag to show the events related to it. Other tags are then grayed out in the list and and the events not bearing this tag are hidden.
- several tags can be selected simultaneously: events bearing one **or** the other will be displayed
- click a tag again to unselect it 
- when all tags are unselected, the display is reset: all events are shown and all tags are shown in black.
