# Setting up a simplified login username


## Introduction

In order to allow users to connect to BlueMind by simply entering their username (leaving out the domain name, e.g. "jdoe" instead of "jdoe@bluemind.loc"), you can set up a default domain on the server side.

Other domains

When this is set up, users can still connect to another domain. In that case, they must then enter the full domain name (e.g.: jdoe@yellowmind.loc).

## How to configure a default domain

```
default-domain=bluemind.loc

- Restart the service "bm-hps":


```
service bm-hps restart
```


The login page then appears as follows:
