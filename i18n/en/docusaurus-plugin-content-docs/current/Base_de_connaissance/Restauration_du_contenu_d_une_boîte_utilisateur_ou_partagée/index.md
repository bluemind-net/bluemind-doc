# Restoring user or mailshare mailbox contents


## Introduction

This page describes the procedure to follow in the following cases:

1. The contents of a user's mailbox must be restored and ** [Single-user restoration using DataProtect](https://forge.bluemind.net/confluence/display/BM35/Restauration+unitaire+-+Navigation+DataProtect) has failed**.
2. You want to restore the **contents of a user's mailbox into another user's mailbox**.


BlueMind provides a couple of shell and python scripts to help you with restoring data from a user mailbox backup.


## Prerequisites

To be able to use these scripts, the [Python Client](/Guide_du_dÃ©veloppeur/API_BlueMind/Client_Python/) must be installed on the machine.

## Useful files

## Procedure

The script `restore.sh` will restore user data from the backup directory into a user's or another user's mailbox, as required, into a sub-folder named `restored_<timestamp>`.

To start it:


```
./restore.sh USER|MAILSHARE BACKUP\_PATH USER|MAILSHARE EMAIL\_ADDRESS
```


- `USER|MAILSHARE`: to restore a user use the keyword USER, to restore a shared mailbox use the keyword MAILSHARE
- `BACKUP_PATH`: path to the data in the BlueMind backup directory (/var/backups). The path looks like:


**
User


**
Mailshare


`/var/backups/bluemind/dp_spool/rsync/<IP>/mail/imap/<backup
 number>/var/spool/cyrus/data/<bluemind 
domain>/domain/<domain initial>/<domaine 
bluemind>/<user initial>/user/<user>/`
E.g. for the user "jdoe" on the domain "bluemind.loc":
`/var/backups/bluemind/dp_spool/rsync/192.168.122.148/mail/imap/806/var/spool/cyrus/data/bluemind_loc/domain/b/bluemind.loc/j/user/jdoe/`


`/var/backups/bluemind/dp_spool/rsync/<IP>/mail/imap/<sauvegarde>/var/spool/cyrus/data/<domaine>/domain/<initiale_domaine>/<domaine>/`
You can see that for a mailbox, the path stops at the domain level. Therefore, the path is always the same for all mailshares of the domain.
E.g. in our sample domain "bluemind.loc", path will be:
`/var/backups/bluemind/dp_spool/rsync/192.168.122.148/mail/imap/806/var/spool/cyrus/data/bluemind_loc/domain/b/bluemind.loc/`


- `USER|MAILSHARE`: as for first keyword, indicates the target mailbox type
- `EMAIL_ADDRESS`: email address for the target mailbox you want to restore the data into


Then, you have 4 possibilities:


**
User > User


**
User > Mailshare


**
Mailshare > User


**
Mailshare > Mailshare
